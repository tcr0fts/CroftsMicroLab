      <p class="news-post-details">Elizabeth and Sophia presented the culmination of 6 months of research in the Crofts' microbiology lab at the 23rd annual Florida State University Undergraduate Research Symposium.</p>
      <p>Pictured Left: Elizabeth has been studying genes from the goose gut microbiome that confer resistance to the medically vital antibiotic colistin. She found several new genes that allow E. coli to become resistant to high levels of this antibiotic and their presence in the goose gut microbiome has important implications for colistin use in agriculture and medicine and the potential for resistance genes to be spread.
      </p>
      <p>Pictured Right: Sophia's project focuses on the antibiotic tiamulin. While not normally susceptible to it, E. coli can be made vulnerable through the use of efflux pump inhibitors, allowing Sophia to use this bacterium to study novel tiamulin resistance genes from the environment.
